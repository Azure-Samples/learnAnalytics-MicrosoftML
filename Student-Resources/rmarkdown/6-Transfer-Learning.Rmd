## Pre-Trained Models

Transfer learning is a pretty incredible method for learning expressive models without having to train a deep architecture from scratch. In some ways, it's nearly a "free-lunch": take a pre-built model trained for weeks on a large image corpus, and reuse the features from that model for your domain-specific task.

`MicrosoftML` ships with a number of pre-trained DNNs on the [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) challenge dataset

```{r pretrainedDNN}
AlexNetFeatures <- read.csv(system.file(
  "extdata/ImageAnalyticsTestData/featurizeImage_alexnet_output.csv",
  package = "MicrosoftML"), 
  header = FALSE)

ResNet18Features <- read.csv(system.file(
  "extdata/ImageAnalyticsTestData/featurizeImage_resnet18_output.csv",
  package = "MicrosoftML"),
  header = FALSE)

ResNet50Features <- read.csv(system.file(
  "extdata/ImageAnalyticsTestData/featurizeImage_resnet50_output.csv",
  package = "MicrosoftML"), 
  header = FALSE)

ResNet101Features <- read.csv(system.file(
  "extdata/ImageAnalyticsTestData/featurizeImage_resnet101_output.csv",
  package = "MicrosoftML"), 
  header = FALSE)

lapply(list(AlexNetFeatures, ResNet18Features, ResNet50Features, ResNet101Features),
       dim)
```

## CMU Faces Dataset

For this notebook, we'll use the [CMU Faces dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/CMU+Face+Images) compiled by Tom Mitchell and his students way back in 1999.

```{r cmufaces}


# get paths to full-resolution images, regex"[[:alpha:]_]+.pgm"
# see: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/faces-mld/faces.data.html for image resolution info
# prepare training and testing data, extract labels: left VS right
l <- "left"
r <- "right"
imgs_l <- list.files("../data/faces",
                     pattern = paste0(l, "[[:alpha:]_]+.pgm"),
                     recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)
imgs_r <- list.files("../data/faces",
                     pattern = paste0(r, "[[:alpha:]_]+.pgm"), 
                     recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)

l_l <- length(imgs_l)
l_r <- length(imgs_r)

train_l_l <- ceiling(l_l / 2) #get balanced train and test set, split each class by half
train_l_r <- ceiling(l_r / 2)

trainIndex_l <- sample(l_l, train_l_l)
trainIndex_r <- sample(l_r, train_l_r)

train_df <- data.frame(Path = c(imgs_l[trainIndex_l], imgs_r[trainIndex_r]),
                       Label = c(rep(TRUE, train_l_l), rep(FALSE, train_l_r)),
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

test_df <- data.frame(Path = c(imgs_l[-trainIndex_l], imgs_r[-trainIndex_r]),
                      Label = c(rep(TRUE, l_l-train_l_l), rep(FALSE, l_r-train_l_r)),
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

train_df <- train_df[sample(nrow(train_df)),]
test_df <- test_df[sample(nrow(test_df)),]

lapply(list(train_df, test_df), dim)

```

## On-the Fly Featurization

We can develop features on-the-fly and embed them into any of the `MicrosoftML` learners. This is especially useful if we want to train on data that is too large to fit in memory, so instead we work in batches.


```{r featurizeTransforms}

mlTransform <- list(loadImage(vars = list(Image = "Path")),
                    resizeImage(vars = "Image", 
                                width = 224, height = 224, 
                                resizingOption = "IsoPad"),
                    extractPixels(vars = list(Pixels = "Image")),
                    featurizeImage(var = "Pixels", outVar = "Feature", 
                                   dnnModel = "resnet101"))

model <- rxLogisticRegression(Label ~ Feature, 
                              data = train_df,
                              mlTransforms = mlTransform, mlTransformVars = "Path")
summary(model)

score  <- rxPredict(model, test_df, extraVarsToWrite = "Label")
sum(score$Label==score$PredictedLabel)/nrow(score)
rxRocCurve("Label","Probability", score)

```

## Retaining Features

While the above approach is scalable beyond datasets that can fit in memory, it has the drawback of not being reusable. In paricular, we can't "pull-out" the features we trained on our dataset for later use.

If you would like to retain the features you trained on, you can do so by using the `featurizeImage` function in MicrosoftML directly. It is analogous to the `mlTransforms` argumenet above.

```{r featurizeImage}
rxFeaturize(data = train_df, 
            outData = "../data/train.xdf", 
            overwrite = TRUE,
            mlTransforms = list(loadImage(vars = list(Image = "Path")),
                                resizeImage(vars = "Image", 
                                            width = 224, height = 224, 
                                            resizingOption = "IsoPad"),
                                extractPixels(vars = list(Pixels = "Image")),
                                featurizeImage(var = "Pixels", 
                                               outVar = "Feature", 
                                               dnnModel = "resnet18")),
            mlTransformVars = c("Path", "Label")) -> train_xdf

rxFeaturize(data = test_df, outData = "../data/test.xdf", overwrite = TRUE,
            mlTransforms = list(loadImage(vars = list(Image = "Path")),
                                resizeImage(vars = "Image", width = 224, height = 224,
                                            resizingOption = "IsoPad"),
                                extractPixels(vars = list(Pixels = "Image")),
                                featurizeImage(var = "Pixels", 
                                               outVar = "Feature", 
                                               dnnModel = "resnet18")),
            mlTransformVars = c("Path", "Label")) -> test_xdf

varInfo <- rxGetVarInfo(train_xdf)

features <- paste("Feature", 0:511, sep=".", collapse = " + ")
form <- as.formula(paste("Label", features, sep="~"))
model <- rxLogisticRegression(formula = form, data = train_xdf)

summary(model)
score <-rxPredict(model, test_xdf, extraVarsToWrite = "Label")
sum(score$Label==score$PredictedLabel)/nrow(score)
rxRocCurve("Label","Probability",score)
```
