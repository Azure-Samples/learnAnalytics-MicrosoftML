## Text Classification

Let's take a look at using `MML` to estimate a model that would be very hard to do with `RevoScaleR`. 

In particular, there are virtually no functionality in `RevoScaleR` for handling large text data. We will use `MML` to transform text data into useful features that we can use in a logistic regression learner. In order to deal with the high cardinality of text data, we will use the penalized regression models in `MML`.

### IMDB Data

Our data is taken from the paper __Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis__ written in 2011 by Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. The paper and data are available here: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/. I've already downloaded and converted the data into an XDF. Please see the `1-ingest-data.R` script if you are interested in the ingestion process.

```{r load_imdb}

train_xdf <- RxXdfData("../data/imdb-train.xdf")
test_xdf <- RxXdfData("../data/imdb-test.xdf")

```



### Feature Transformers

MicrosoftML has a set of functions for feature engineering. In this example, let's take a look at creating sparse word vectors.

We'll use the `featurizeText` function to convert our text data into numeric columns. In particular, we'll ask for new columns with tri-grams after removing stopwords, punctuations, and numbers.

We can do this transform directly in our modeling call, and in particular, we'll train logistic regression models and a fast gradient boosted tree model:

```{r train_models}

system.time(logit_model <- rxLogisticRegression(sentiment ~ reviewTran,
                                                data = train_xdf,
                                                l1Weight = 0.05,
                                                l2Weight = 0.05,
                                                mlTransforms = list(featurizeText(vars = c(reviewTran = "review"),
                                                                                  language = "English",
                                                                                  stopwordsRemover = stopwordsDefault(),
                                                                                  wordFeatureExtractor = ngramCount(3),
                                                                                  keepNumbers = FALSE,
                                                                                  keepPunctuations = FALSE)))
)



system.time(fast_trees <- rxFastTrees(sentiment ~ reviewTran,
                                       data = train_xdf,
                                       mlTransforms = list(featurizeText(vars = c(reviewTran = "review"),
                                                                         language = "English",
                                                                         stopwordsRemover = stopwordsDefault(),
                                                                         wordFeatureExtractor = ngramCount(3),
                                                                         keepNumbers = FALSE,
                                                                         keepPunctuations = FALSE)))
)

```

Now that we have our trained model, we can do some visualizations. For example, for the elastic net, we can visualize the coefficients.

```{r coefs}

logit_cof <- coefficients(logit_model)
coefs <- data.frame(coef = logit_cof, word = names(logit_cof))
coefs <- tbl_df(coefs)

coefs <- coefs %>%
  filter(word != "(Bias)") %>% 
  mutate(abs_value = abs(coef), 
         sentiment = ifelse(coef > 0, "Positive", "Negative"), 
         score = round(abs_value, 0)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(abs_value)) %>% slice(1:100) 


library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

coefs %>% 
  ggplot +
    aes(x = 1, y = 1, colour = sentiment, size = score, label = word) +
    geom_text_repel(segment.size = 0, force = 10) +
    scale_size(range = c(2, 15), guide = FALSE) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
    labs(x = '', y = '') +
    theme_classic() +
    facet_wrap(~sentiment)

```

Let's try and makea  more interactive visual. We'll use `purrr` again to map our coefficients to the beautiful [d3wordcloud](https://github.com/jbkunst/d3wordcloud) package

```{r d3word}

coefs %>% 
  split(.$sentiment) %>% 
  purrr::map( ~ d3wordcloud(.$word, .$score, tooltip = TRUE)) -> d3_graphs

d3_graphs[[1]]
d3_graphs[[2]]

```


### Testing the Logit Model

In order to predict our classifer on test data, we will use the `mxPredict` function from the `MML` package.

```{r scorelogit}

predictions <- rxPredict(logit_model, data = test_xdf, extraVarsToWrite = "sentiment")
roc_results <- rxRoc(actualVarName = "sentiment", predVarNames = "Probability.1", data = predictions)
roc_results$predVarName <- factor(roc_results$predVarName)
plot(roc_results)

```

### Testing the Fast Trees Model

```{r score_sdca}
predictions <- rxPredict(fast_trees, data = test_xdf, extraVarsToWrite = "sentiment")
roc_results <- rxRoc(actualVarName = "sentiment", predVarNames = "Probability.1", data = predictions)
roc_results$predVarName <- factor(roc_results$predVarName)
plot(roc_results)


```



## Neural Networks

Let's try to estimate another binary classifier from this dataset, but with a Neural Network architecture rather than a logistic regression model. 

In the following chunk, we call our neural  network model, and set the optimizer to be a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0.2. Furthermore, we use the `type` argument to ensure we are learning a binary classifier. By default our network architecture will have 100 hidden nodes.

```{r nnex}

nn_sentiment <- rxNeuralNet(sentiment ~ reviewTran,
                            data = train_xdf,
                            type = "binary",
                            mlTransforms = list(featurizeText(vars = c(reviewTran = "review"),
                                                         language = "English",
                                                         stopwordsRemover = stopwordsDefault(),
                                                         keepPunctuations = FALSE)),
                          # acceleration = "gpu",
                          miniBatchSize = 4)

```

### Scoring the Neural Net

We can similary score our results from the neural network model

```{r}
predictions <- rxPredict(nn_sentiment, data = test_xdf, extraVarsToWrite = "sentiment")
roc_results <- rxRoc(actualVarName = "sentiment", predVarNames = "Probability.1", data = predictions)
roc_results$predVarName <- factor(roc_results$predVarName)
plot(roc_results)
```
