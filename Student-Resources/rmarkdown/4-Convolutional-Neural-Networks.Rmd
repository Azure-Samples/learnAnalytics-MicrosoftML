## Convolutional Neural Networks

In the previous section we conducted multi-class classification using a softmax regression algorithm. The most popular approach for image classification is now convolutional neural networks. This module describes how to use convolutional networks.

MicrosoftML uses the [Net#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-azure-ml-netsharp-reference-guide) specification for defining neural network architectures. In the `../nnet` directory, we have already created the specifications for you.

Examine the architecture in "MNIST.nn". In this network, we have two convolutional layers and one fully connected layer. 


```{r nnet}
rxNeuralNetFile <- file.path("../nnet/MNIST.nn")
nn <- readChar(rxNeuralNetFile, file.info(rxNeuralNetFile)$size)
nnet_fit <- rxNeuralNet(make_form(splits$train, 
                                           resp_var = "Label", 
                                           vars_to_skip = c("splitVar")),
                              data = splits$train,
                              type = "multiClass",
                              numIterations = 9,
                              netDefinition = nn,
                              initWtsDiameter = 1.0,
                              normalize = "No")
```

As in the previous section with linear classifiers, we can create our confusion matrices:

```{r nnet_scores}

nnet_score <- rxPredict(modelObject = nnet_fit,
                        data = splits$test,
                        outData = tempfile(fileext = ".xdf"),
                        overwrite = TRUE,
                        extraVarsToWrite = "Label")

```

Now that we have our scored results, let's put them in a confusion matrix:

```{r nnet_confusion}

rxCube( ~ Label : PredictedLabel , data = nnet_score,
       returnDataFrame = TRUE) -> nnet_scores_df

nnet_scores_df %>% 
  tbl_df %>% 
  group_by(Label) %>% 
  mutate(rate = Counts/sum(Counts)) %>%
  mutate(error_rate = ifelse(Label == PredictedLabel,
                             0, rate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Label, y = PredictedLabel, fill = error_rate)) +
  geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "steelblue2", high = "mediumblue",
                        labels = scales::percent)

```

Just judging from the label it looks we have already done better than the linear classifier. 

## LeNet-5

Convolutional neural networks were popularized by Yann LeCun. In this section, we'll fit his model from 1998, effectionately called [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf).

The network differs from the previous implementation in that there are now more layers, but in between layers there is a pooling/sampling layer. This helps preventing the neural network from overfitting in between layers and extracting higher-order representations from the data.

Because this neural network has significantly more weights to learn, it'll take a while longer, especially if we aren't using GPUs (which would give us at least 5-7x speed improvement). If you're especially impatient, you can lower the `numIterations` parameter.

```{r lenet-5}

rxNeuralNetFile <- file.path("../nnet/LeCun5.nn")
lecun <- readChar(rxNeuralNetFile, file.info(rxNeuralNetFile)$size)
system.time(lenet_fit <- rxNeuralNet(make_form(splits$train,
                                               resp_var = "Label",
                                               vars_to_skip = c("splitVar")),
                                     data = splits$train,
                                     type = "multiClass",
                                     numIterations = 9,
                                     netDefinition = lecun,
                                     initWtsDiameter = 1.0,
                                     normalize = "No"))

```

As before, let's score our pretty model:

```{r lescores}


lescores <- rxPredict(modelObject = lenet_fit,
                      data = splits$test,
                      outData = tempfile(fileext = ".xdf"),
                      overwrite = TRUE,
                      extraVarsToWrite = "Label")


```

and visualize our error rates:


```{r leconfusion}

rxCube( ~ Label : PredictedLabel , data = lescores,
       returnDataFrame = TRUE) -> le_scores_df

le_scores_df %>% 
  tbl_df %>% 
  group_by(Label) %>% 
  mutate(rate = Counts/sum(Counts)) %>%
  mutate(error_rate = ifelse(Label == PredictedLabel,
                             0, rate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Label, y = PredictedLabel, fill = error_rate)) +
  geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "steelblue2", high = "mediumblue",
                        labels = scales::percent)

```

Looks even better!

## Model Metrics

While our visualizations provide some insight into our model's improvement, let's try to calculate empricial metrics of our models' performacne.

The three metrics we'll focus on are "accuracy", "precision", and "recall". Accuracy simply measures how many of our estimates we classified correctly. While simple and intuitive, it does not account for class-imbalances. For example, if 99% of our data is in class A, and we simply use the rule that everything is class A, we'll get an accuracy of 99%. Sounds impressive, but probably not going to win any Turing tests.

### Accuracy 

To calculate accuracy, we can simply measure the sum of our confusion matrix's diagonal over all values. Our data was in a long format to make it amenable for visualizations using ggplot2. Here we'll use `tidyr` to put it into a wide format amenable for calculating model metrics quickly and efficiently.

```{r accuracy}

calc_accuracy <- function(scores_df) {
  
  library(tidyr)
  
  scores_df <- as.data.frame(scores_df)
  scores_conf <- scores_df %>% spread(PredictedLabel, Counts)
  
  scores_conf <- as.matrix(scores_conf[, 2:ncol(scores_conf)])
  sum(diag(scores_conf))/sum(scores_conf)
  
}

sprintf("Accuracy of the softmax model is %s", calc_accuracy(softmax_scores_df))
sprintf("Accuracy of the convolutional model is %s", calc_accuracy(nnet_scores_df))
sprintf("Accuracy of the LeCun-5 model is %s", calc_accuracy(le_scores_df))

```

### Precision

Precision is another measure of model performance. It calculates the ratio of true positives to all values, i.e., how precise your model is in classifying any digit. To calculate precision, we'll take the diagonal of our confusion matrix over the sum of that column.

```{r precision}


calc_precision <- function(scores_df) {
  
  library(tidyr)
  
  scores_df <- as.data.frame(scores_df)
  scores_conf <- scores_df %>% spread(PredictedLabel, Counts)
  
  scores_conf <- as.matrix(scores_conf[, 2:ncol(scores_conf)])
  diag(scores_conf)/colSums(scores_conf)
  
}

calc_precision(softmax_scores_df)

```

### Recall

Lastly, we can calculate recall. Recall is a measure of how relevant the predictions are for the given class, i.e., how many of the actual classes were properly predicted. In this case, we'll sum over the predicted labels rather than the actual labels:

```{r recall}

calc_recall <- function(scores_df) {
  
  library(tidyr)
  
  scores_df <- as.data.frame(scores_df)
  scores_conf <- scores_df %>% spread(PredictedLabel, Counts)
  
  scores_conf <- as.matrix(scores_conf[, 2:ncol(scores_conf)])
  diag(scores_conf)/rowSums(scores_conf)
  
}

calc_recall(softmax_scores_df)


```

### Visualzing our Metrics

Let's calculate the metrics for all three of our mdoels and visualize them.

```{r calc_metrics}

results <- list(softmax = softmax_scores_df,
                nnet = nnet_scores_df,
                lecun5 = le_scores_df)

metrics_df <- data.frame(
  map_df(results, calc_precision),
  digits = 0:9,
  metric = rep("precision", 10)
) %>% 
  bind_rows(data.frame(
    map_df(results, calc_recall),
    digits = 0:9,
    metric = rep("recall", 10))
  )

metrics_df %>% gather(model, metrics, -digits, -metric) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(digits),
             y = metrics,
             fill = model)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = "dodge")

```
